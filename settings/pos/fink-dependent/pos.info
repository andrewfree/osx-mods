DescDetail: << 

cdf and posd:

posd is an osascript embedded in a shell script that returns the pwd
corresponding to the frontmost finder window.  Its real value is when
aliased to the command cdf, i.e., cdf='cd "$(/sw/bin/posd)"'.  The command
cdf changes the terminal pwd to match that of the frontmost finder window.

fdc: 

fdc is essentially the reciprocal operation of cdf.  It changes the finder window to match the pwd of the terminal in which the command is issued.

A further powerful use of posd is in conjunction with a posd.term file that is
created from saving an open terminal session after setting all defaults to the prefered state.  Then change the lines in the new posd.term

     <key>ExecutionString</key> 
     <string></string> 

to the following for a tcsh terminal session:

    <key>ExecutionString</key> 
    <string>cd "`/sw/bin/posd`"; pwd </string> 

or to the following for a zsh or bash session:

    <key>ExecutionString</key>
    <string>cd "$(/sw/bin/posd)";pwd</string>


and the resulting file is a clickable icon that can be placed in the finder 
tool bar.  Clicking opens a new terminal window corresponding to the finder.
